It's hot and dusty here.
The ground is cracked and hard.
But if I go a little further...
it might get a little better. 

## Instructions

I think I'm on a journey. I have a backpack and a bit of water. I need the water to keep my energy up.

There's someone waiting for me.

Some of it is pretty heavy.

My backpack is so heavy when it's full, I can't keep everything.

I'm going to a party.
I don't want to arrive empty handed.
